# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms find patterns in unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no target labels to guide the learning process.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. Clustering
Grouping similar data points together.
- **Example**: Customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
Reducing the number of features while preserving important information.
- **Example**: Data visualization, feature extraction, noise reduction

### 3. Association Rules
Finding relationships between variables.
- **Example**: Market basket analysis, recommendation systems

## Models Included

### Clustering Algorithms
- [K-Means](../unsupervised/clustering/kmeans/)
- [Hierarchical Clustering](../unsupervised/clustering/hierarchical_clustering/)
- [DBSCAN](../unsupervised/clustering/dbscan/)
- [Gaussian Mixture Models](../unsupervised/clustering/gaussian_mixture/)

### Dimensionality Reduction
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](../unsupervised/dimensionality_reduction/pca/)
- [t-SNE](../unsupervised/dimensionality_reduction/t_sne/)
- [Autoencoders](../unsupervised/dimensionality_reduction/autoencoders/)

## Common Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather unlabeled data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features
4. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose appropriate unsupervised method
5. **Model Training**: Fit model to data
6. **Interpretation**: Analyze and interpret results
7. **Visualization**: Visualize clusters or reduced dimensions
8. **Application**: Use insights for downstream tasks
