# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that we can make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. Regression
Predicting continuous numerical values.
- **Example**: Predicting house prices, temperature, stock prices

### 2. Classification
Predicting discrete categorical labels.
- **Example**: Email spam detection, image recognition, disease diagnosis

## Models Included

## Common Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather labeled training data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and prepare data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select and create relevant features
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm
5. **Training**: Fit model to training data
6. **Evaluation**: Test on validation/test data
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
8. **Deployment**: Use model for predictions
